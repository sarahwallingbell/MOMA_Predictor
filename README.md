# MOMA_Predictor
Three methods for handling imbalanced data for classification with decision trees. 

A collaboration with two classmates train decision tree that classifies the gender of an artist based on the title of their artwork<sup>*</sup>. We used a publically available Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) dataset containing titles and other metadata about their art collection. 







<sup>*</sup>We predict gender based on a binary gender classification because that is the extent of our dataset. We recognize that this does not reflect the full spectrum of gender in reality. We are not assuming that biological sex has anything to do with the way that people write. Instead, based on prior research, we posit that the pressures in society to adequately perform one’s gender may have an impact on one’s text-based self-expression.
